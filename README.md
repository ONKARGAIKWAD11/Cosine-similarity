Banker-Customer Transaction Data Similarity for Alert Recommendations

In the field of finance and banking, it is crucial for bankers to set up alert systems that notify customers about potential risks or suspicious activities related to their transactions. To enhance the effectiveness of these alert systems, a recommendation system can be developed that analyzes the similarity between the alert patterns set by bankers and the transaction data of individual customers.

The recommendation system utilizes techniques such as data encoding and cosine similarity to identify patterns and calculate the similarity scores between the alert patterns and customer transaction data. By finding the similarity scores, the system can generate personalized recommendations for customers based on their transaction history, identifying relevant alerts that align with their specific transaction patterns.

The system aims to provide bankers with a more efficient and accurate means of recommending alerts to customers. By leveraging the similarity between alert patterns and customer transaction data, the system enhances the chances of detecting potential risks or suspicious activities, enabling proactive measures to be taken by both the bankers and customers.

Overall, the development of a banker-customer transaction data similarity recommendation system contributes to the improvement of alert systems in the banking sector, ensuring better customer protection and risk management.
